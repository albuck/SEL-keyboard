# Standard Ergonomic Keyboard with staggered keys

It is a compact SEL keyboard layout. It takes up as much space as a traditional keyboard, plus an extra two buttons. The keyboard is completely symmetrical to the left and right sides. The keyboard includes a set of ISO keyboard characters (i.e., has a 105th key).

The goal was to make only the most important and minimal changes to address the shortcomings of the traditional keyboard.
